# 1 Purpose

We are going to explore 2 time series using Metaâ€™s Prophet forecasting system.It is a tool that would make accurate prediction on future values in any time series data using a simple parameters. It is fast,easy and can handle with any errors such as missing values.It can be modelled in weeks, months or years and depends on trends, seasonality, holiday and error. 

# 2 Mauna Lou Atmospheric CO2 Concentration

## 2.1 Introduction

Manua Loa is an active and shield volcano in the US state of Hawaii. It is one of the largest volcano by both mass and volume- which is 75000 cubic kilometre. It records how much atmospheric concentrations of CO2 are released from Mauna Loa in parts per million (ppm). It is already stored in R as 'co2'
A time series of 468 observations is recorded from 1959 to 1997 and is recorded monthly. However, there are few observations from 1964 is missing and therefore is obtained by interpolation. The usage of r code "co2" is where the data of 468 observations of the amount of CO2 concentration released is stored.

## 2.2 Predicting the values

We want to know the predictions of the amount of CO2 concentration is released into the atmosphere in 1998 and 1999. So, we would use Prophet's forecasting system to find the prediction. 
```{r}
dataFrame = data.frame(ds=zoo::as.yearmon(time(co2)),y=co2)#Creating this time series into data frame
model = prophet::prophet(dataFrame)
future = prophet::make_future_dataframe(model, periods=24, freq="month")#It creates future dates of 1998 and 1999 monthly.
forecast = predict(model, future)#It adds 24 future values into the data frame.
tail(forecast[c('ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper')])# Only showing the last 6 dates and its predicted values.
```
The code 'make_future_dataframe' is where future dates is created in number of periods you picked.

## 2.3 Plot

### 2.3.1 Display
```{r}
plot(model,forecast, xlab="Years", ylab="Concentration of CO2 (ppm)",main="Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO2 Concentration")
prophet::prophet_plot_components(model, forecast)#Broke dowm into trend and yearly seasonality.
```

These graphs show the full observations including the future dates and its predicted values.We can tell that the amount of CO2 concentration released increases during the spring and summer, but decreases during autumn and winter, where the highest peak in the every year is May. This is due to the high temperatures during spring and summer where CO2 are released quickly. Low temperature, on the other hand, do slow down release of concentration. But as years goes by, the concentration of CO2 gradually increases. This is because of emissions caused by human, damaging the climate changes. One example for this is deforestation around Mauna Loa, where trees, which stores CO2, are cut down, releasing more CO2. concentrations.

### 2.3.2 Dygraph
```{r}
library(dygraphs)
prediction<-forecast[c('ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper')]#Predicted values
dygraph(prediction, main = "New Concentration") %>% dyRangeSelector(dateWindow = c("1998-01-01", "1999-12-01"))# Dygraph showing the predictions in 1998 and 1999 with upper bound and lower bound
```
The dygraph shows the predictions of the values of CO2 concentration being released to the atmosphere. We can tell that it follows the same pattern as the original observations.

# 3 Peyton Manning's Wikipedia Page


![Peyton Manning](images/Peyton Manning.jpg)


## 3.1 Introduction

The forecasting system can also be use to show the time series of how many people have visited on one  Wikipedia page and is capable of showing multiple seasonality and growth rates. A Wikipedia page of a former NFL player Peyton Manning is one of the example.He is one of NFL greatest quarterbacks of all time. He played for Indianapolis Colts for 14 seasons and Denver Broncos for 4 seasons before retiring in 2016.
A time series showing the data of daily views of Peyton Manning is stored on this website:
<https://github.com/facebook/prophet/blob/main/examples/example_wp_log_peyton_manning.csv>
This time series shows 2905 observations taken from 10th December 2007 to 20 January 2016 daily. Because of high differences in number of views between one date and another date, it could lead to lots of anomalous values,log transformations was used in order to stabilise the variance. Therefore daily views were taken in log.

## 3.2 Predicting the future values

We would want to know how the views of Wikipedia changes for 1 year to January 2017. So we would use the prophet forecasting system to find out.
```{r}
dataFrame2 <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/facebook/prophet/main/examples/example_wp_log_peyton_manning.csv')#Creating this time series from the website into data frame.
model2 = prophet::prophet(dataFrame2)
future2 = prophet::make_future_dataframe(model2, periods=365)#It creates future dates from 21st January to 20th January 2017.
forecast2 = predict(model2, future2)#It adds 24 future values into the data frame.
tail(forecast2[c('ds', 'yhat', 'yhat_lower', 'yhat_upper')])# Only showing the last 6 future dates with predicted values.
```

The futures dates indicate an decrease in numbers on views. This could be due to his retirement.

## 3.3 Graphs

### 3.3.1 Plots

```{r}
plot(model2, forecast2,xlab="dates",ylab="Daily Views (log(y))",main="Peyton Mannings")
```
In this graph,the daily views is fairly constant throughout the years between around 6.5 and 10(665 and 22,026). But, in some days, there were more people visited Peyton Manning's Wikipedia pages as high as around 12.8(362,217 views) because of his achievement and performances in one of his matches. Sometimes, the views were lower, with the lowest being 5.3(200 views).

### 3.3.2 Seasonality

We can further broke down into trend and 2 seasonality: weekly and yearly.

```{r}
prophet::prophet_plot_components(model2, forecast2)#Graph broken down into 2 sesonalities and trend.
```

#### 3.3.2.1 Trend

The trend graph started off with decrease in trends. This is because of the 2007 season of NFL have ended, meaning it may not be a point to view any NFL players during off-season. But, when 2008 season starts, it stop decreasing and remain constant. As Manning earn a MVP for his performance, trend tends to rise, even during off-season.This shows that Peyton Manning is being recognised. It remain constant after 2009 season with a little decrease, which is still higher than when observations start as he again earn his MVP. In 2011, the trend rises even more. This is because Manning is injured due to neck surgery and is left out for entire season. This was also his last lime in Indianapolis Colts before moving as free agent, so people want to know what happened to him . In 2012, the trend decreases as he moves to Denver Broncos. But in 2013, it increases again as he earn MVP yet again due to his performances in 2013 season, which helped Denver Broncos reached into Super Bowl XLVIII. After 2014, it gradually decreases. This is due to his retirement in 2016.
This shows that change in trend depends on his achievement and performances.
#### 3.3.2.2 Weekly seasonality

NFL games normally plays on Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays, with most games being held on Sundays. Therefore most Manning's matches have been played on Sunday's. This indicates that more people have visited his Wikipedia page on Monday following his Sunday's games. As some of his matches have also played on Monday, Tuesday's data tends to have positive trend. However, other days tend to go negative as games doesn't normally played on these days - meaning less people looking at Manning's Wikipedia page - with Saturday even lower as his games don't often played on Fridays.

#### 3.3.2.3 Yearly Seasonality

Any season of NFL start in weekend following Labor's Day in September with a regular season and ends with Super Bowl in 2nd Sunday of February. Regular season ends in January, when play-offs began. There's no NFL matches from after Super Bowl. So less people would look at any Wikipedia pages, including Peyton Manning, from the end of Super Bowl. Therefore, this would lead to decrease in trend. But, when pre-season starts, trends rises meaning people would then look at Manning's Wikipedia page and rapidly increases back to positive when regular season starts. The highest peak is around the start of February where play-off season and Super Bowl take place.

### 3.3.3 Dynamic plots

```{r}
prophet::dyplot.prophet(model2, forecast2)# Dygraph showing trends including predicted values and dates from 2016 to 2017.
```
The dygraph shows the interactive forecast of this time series. It can be use to explore the predicted value in depth by moving timeline so that we can see how the prediction goes.

# 4 Comparision

In Mauna Loa CO2 Concentration's forecast, the trend tend to increase overtime whereas in Peyton Manning's forecast, the trend do increase at start before it decreases gradually. This is because Peyton Manning's forecast, it rely on people viewing in which people can change their habit on this, whereas in Mauna Loa's forecast, it rely on concentration of CO2 rising in the atmosphere,in which people can't change their habit. It's also worth noting that people changing their habit in viewing Wikipedia pages can varied the number of daily views.
Also, Mauna Loa's forecast only observed monthly, whereas Payton Manning's forecast does observed daily, meaning that despite very large dataset, it can give accurate result.
